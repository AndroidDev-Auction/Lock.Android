/**
 * This class allows an IdentityProvider to request specific Android Manifest Permissions
 * before calling start. This provider handles the Runtime Permissions introduced by Android M.
 * <p/>
 * If the device is running Android 5.1 or lower, or your app's target SDK is 22 or lower,
 * then the user must grant all the required permissions when they install the app, so this provider
 * will fallback to work as a simple IdentityProvider.
 * If the device is running Android 6.0 or higher, and your app's target SDK is 23 or higher,
 * the app must request the user each required dangerous permission before trying to use it.
 * <p/>
 * For more information about normal and dangerous permissions, along with Android M Runtime
 * Permissions, check http://developer.android.com/training/permissions/requesting.html
